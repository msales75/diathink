* Get ListView and ListItemView working nested.
   Need to define controller for ListView inside ListItemView at correct time -
    create a new branch of ListView to do this.
* Get nestedSortable working on top of ListItems
* Trigger ListView update to/from nestedSortable moves, in up to two lists.

Later:
---------
Status, Schedule, Delegation (dependency as subtask?)
Statuses could just be reference-lists with a special UI? 
   (unfiled/someday/later/soon/now/wait-for/wait-until/completed/scheduled-event)
Similarly for delegation?
 - Reference-parents can be shown as a quick-tag; UI for changing quick-tags
 - Change-tags-on-date  (common notification-profiles)
 - Change-tags-on-dependency
 * Filter for tags? (#today, #soon, #later, #someday) and (@mark or @john)
       (Same-list is 'or', different lists are 'and')
 * Browse by calendar (outline ok)

Special outline of tags: #status @person



Comment-view: very different UI
  shows children and reference-chains as conversation-threads?
Optional-verb for references?
Browse reverse-references as parents?
Notices?
Friends?
